                <p>This child website was one of the first sites I have made. Its purpose was to advertise and organize the annual IPATA conference in 2016. It could be found at <a href="http://www.ipata.org/kul-conference-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ipata.org/kul-conference-home</a>. It was designed on a website that already existed.</p>
                
                <p>The site needed to accommodate all the different aspects of the conference and organize them for easy access. It also had to be mobile friendly. The home page displays each of the other pages with a little blurb.</p>
                
                <p>It was made using HTML and CSS along with a website editing software owned by the company. Web pages included: Home, Ads &amp; Exhibits, Attendees, Awards, FaceTime, Hotel, Registration, Schedule, Silent Auction, Sponsorship, Things to Do, Travel, Visa Letter.</p>
                
                <p>One of the challenges I faced was making sure to create a mobile friendly site. By using Media Queries and a specific mobile image, I was able to create a design that kept the theme alive.</p>

                <p>Examples of a few of the other pages are shown below. Most pages were information specific. The right sidebar was the same on each page using a widget.</p>

                <h3><span class="bold">The Process</span></h3>
                <p>This website was made using a content manager provided by the company and with handwritten HTML and CSS. Any CSS had to be written out and much of the HTML was hand written as well.</p>

                <p>To begin, research was done to see what ideas were already out there for conferences. Then I considered the purpose and needs of the website.</p>

                <img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400/4bec4c40433083.57f7486f3625f.png" />

                <p>Designs were drawn out by hand and then replicated in Photoshop. At first, the ideas that I had were rough and would not have worked in the space allowed. But I soon realized my error and created designs that would work along with ideas about the mobile version of these pages.</p>

                <p>After realizing some limitations on the site, I recreated my original ideas in Photoshop. The entire process was monitored by the Senior Web Developer.</p>

                <p>While the front page was being discussed, I also created corresponding mock ups for some of the other pages that would be created.</p>

                <p>Once a design was settled on, I went ahead and created the rest of the site, verifying with my team for the information and for their approval.</p>

                <div>This process took about 5 months to make.</div>
